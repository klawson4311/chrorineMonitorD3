Q-	How would you expand upon this?
 1) Y-Axis was hard-coded. Appropriate min/max values could've been calculated
 2) Better selection of tools/frameworks. (Not AngularJS)
 3) Implement error handling provisions (ie. if/when the WebSocket disconnects.)
 4) Respond to page resizing
 5) Check feasibility using more accurate means (perhaps a z-score, or even just comparing it to the past value).
 6) Find a means much less obnoxious, and more effective than JS alerts.
 7) Add interaction (ex, show exact values upon hovering over the graph)
 8) Smooth graph transitions.


Q- What worked well?
 D3 was really useful.  This was my first time using it, but I can see using it in other projects in the future.
 However, it appears that v4+ of D3 is significantly different than v3, which most tutorials use.
 Bonus css was a breeze.


Q-	Why AngularJS?
A-	AngularJS can be easily dropped into an existing, or simple application.
	With more time, React or vue.js would be more appropriate.
